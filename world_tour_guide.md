# World Tour — 20 Cities, Attractions & Salary Guidance

> **Note on assumptions:**  
> • Estimates assume a 7‑day solo trip, mid‑range style (economy flight from U.S., 3★ hotel or good Airbnb, mid‑range dining, standard local transport & main attractions).  
> • Rule of thumb: trip cost ≈ 3% of gross yearly salary → so yearly salary ≈ (trip cost) ÷ 0.03.  
> • Real costs vary with origin, season, travel style, deals. Use this as a planning tool.

## A few extra tips & caveats  
- The “yearly salary guideline” is a rough heuristic (trip cost ÷ 0.03) and doesn’t reflect your entire financial situation (savings, debt, other expenses).  
- Flights often make a big difference — from your origin, deals matter.  
- Seasonality: high‑season travel can increase lodging & flights significantly.  
- Travel style: staying ultra‑budget vs luxury will change costs.  
- Local currency/exchange rates, visa fees, health/travel insurance all matter.  
- If you travel with a partner or family, costs double or more — adjust accordingly.

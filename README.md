# tourist_guide_ML_LLM_Project

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project combines **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **interactive app development** to create a fun and practical tool that suggests travel destinations based on estimated income — without ever asking users about their salary directly.

### 🧩 Project Structure

1. **Dataset Selection**
   A reliable dataset containing salary information based on **age, gender, job title, and education level** was used:
   [Salary Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data)

2. **Model Development**
   Several **machine learning models** were trained on this dataset, followed by **hyperparameter tuning** to identify the most accurate model for salary prediction.

3. **City Information Compilation**
   A **Markdown file** was created featuring **20 touristic cities** from around the world.
   Each city includes:

   * Main attractions and activities
   * Recommended income range for travel affordability

4. **Interactive Gradio Application**
   A **Gradio web app** was developed that:

   * Asks users a few short, non-intrusive questions
   * **Estimates their salary** using the trained ML model
   * Suggests **travel destinations** that match their estimated income
   * Displays the results in a **well-structured, brochure-style format** including greetings, highlights, and a conclusion
   * https://huggingface.co/spaces/Aryannajjari/Tourist_Guide_Plan 

### 💡 Key Highlights

* Avoids asking users directly about their income
* Integrates ML predictions with curated travel recommendations
* Provides an elegant and user-friendly experience through Gradio

Would you like me to also add a **“Tech Stack”** and **“How to Run”** section (with icons and code blocks) to make the README look even more professional?
